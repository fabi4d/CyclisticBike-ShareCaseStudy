# CyclisticBike-ShareCaseStudy

Goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to
do that, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why
casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. We are
interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.
